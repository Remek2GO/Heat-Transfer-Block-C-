# Heat-Transfer-Block-C-

This program which I made on a physics constest in 2018. The task was to calculate in what time extreme faces of two blocks of brass with have a deta temperatures fo 100K. My idea was to divide two blocks into small slices. In this way of thinking the heat will transfer into another slices one by one each period of time. The solution in the constest was correct.
